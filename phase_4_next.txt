4: Next.js Built-in Tags and Features

In this phase, we’ll explore some of the most commonly used Next.js built-in tags and features, which help with optimization, routing, and other important tasks. These features make it easy to work with assets, improve performance, and integrate with external services like Google Fonts.

1. Next.js Image Component

Next.js provides the Image component from next/image for optimized image loading. This component helps you automatically handle image optimization, lazy loading, resizing, and format conversion (e.g., converting to WebP for smaller file sizes).

Why use Next.js Image component?

Automatic image optimization: Automatically optimizes images for faster load times, which helps with performance and SEO.

Responsive: Images can be loaded differently based on the device’s screen size and resolution.

Lazy loading: By default, Next.js loads images only when they are about to enter the viewport.

Basic Example:
import Image from 'next/image';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <Image
      src="/images/landscape.jpg"
      alt="Beautiful Landscape"
      width={500}
      height={300}
      quality={75}  // Quality of the image (1-100)
    />
  </div>
);

export default MyComponent;


Attributes:

src: Path to the image file (can be local or external).

alt: Alt text for the image (important for SEO and accessibility).

width & height: Define the image dimensions to prevent layout shifts during loading (important for performance).

quality: Controls the image quality (default is 75).

Advantages:

Automatic resizing: Next.js will automatically resize images for different screen sizes and devices.

Optimized formats: Images may be served in newer formats like WebP for better compression and faster loading.

Responsive: You can provide srcSet for different screen resolutions, and the image will adjust accordingly.

2. Next.js Link Component

The Link component is used for client-side navigation between pages in a Next.js application. It helps with single-page application (SPA) behavior and prevents the page from reloading.

Why use Next.js Link component?

Client-side navigation: Makes navigation faster by preventing the browser from reloading the page.

Automatic pre-fetching: Next.js automatically pre-fetches linked pages in the background to make navigation faster when the user clicks.

Basic Example:
import Link from 'next/link';

const HomePage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to My Next.js App!</h1>
    <Link href="/about">
      <a>Go to About Page</a>
    </Link>
  </div>
);

export default HomePage;


Attributes:

href: The path to the target page (can be a relative or absolute URL).

<a> tag: It's essential to wrap the content in an <a> tag, which Next.js uses to handle the navigation.

Important Features:

Pre-fetching: Next.js automatically pre-fetches the linked page when it becomes visible in the viewport, making navigation faster.

Programmatic navigation: You can use useRouter for programmatic navigation within your app, without a Link component.

3. Next.js Head Component for SEO Optimization

The Head component from next/head allows you to modify the <head> section of your HTML page, which is essential for SEO and defining meta tags (e.g., title, description, Open Graph tags, etc.).

Why use Next.js Head component?

Custom titles: You can dynamically set the title and meta description for each page.

SEO: Helps improve SEO by controlling meta tags, keywords, and social media previews.

Social Media Optimization: Allows you to set Open Graph tags for better link previews on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc.

Basic Example:
import Head from 'next/head';

const HomePage = () => (
  <div>
    <Head>
      <title>My Next.js App</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an awesome Next.js application." />
      <meta name="keywords" content="next.js, react, web development" />
    </Head>
    <h1>Welcome to My Next.js App!</h1>
  </div>
);

export default HomePage;


Attributes:

<title>: Sets the title of the page.

<meta>: Defines meta tags for SEO, such as description, keywords, author, etc.

Best Practices:

Always set a unique title and meta description for each page.

Use Open Graph (og:title, og:description, og:image) and Twitter Card (twitter:title, twitter:description, twitter:image) tags for social media sharing optimization.

4. Google Fonts in Next.js

Next.js has built-in support for Google Fonts, which makes it easy to integrate and optimize them.

Why Use Google Fonts in Next.js?

Fast and efficient font loading.

Automatic optimization: Next.js automatically optimizes fonts to improve performance.

SEO benefits: Using fonts directly from Google Fonts improves page speed and load times.

How to Integrate Google Fonts:

Using next/head: You can link to Google Fonts in the <head> of your HTML using the Head component.

Example:
import Head from 'next/head';

const HomePage = () => (
  <div>
    <Head>
      <link
        href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap"
        rel="stylesheet"
      />
    </Head>
    <h1 style={{ fontFamily: 'Roboto, sans-serif' }}>Welcome to My App</h1>
  </div>
);

export default HomePage;


Optimizing Google Fonts with next/font:

Next.js 13 introduced a built-in next/font feature to optimize Google Fonts and load them in a more efficient way.

Example (Using next/font):
import { Roboto } from 'next/font/google';

const roboto = Roboto({
  weight: '400',
  subsets: ['latin'],
});

const HomePage = () => (
  <div className={roboto.className}>
    <h1>Welcome to My Next.js App</h1>
  </div>
);

export default HomePage;


Benefits:

Google Fonts are automatically optimized for the best performance.

The next/font feature ensures that fonts are only loaded when needed, reducing unnecessary network requests.

5. Next.js Customizing the src/ Folder Structure

In Next.js, src/ folder structure is flexible and customizable. By default, Next.js follows a simple folder structure, but for larger projects, it's a good practice to organize your code based on features.

Custom Folder Structure:
/src
  /components           # Reusable UI components
  /pages                # Routes are automatically created from here
    /index.js           # Home page
    /about.js           # About page
  /styles               # Global and component-specific styles
  /public               # Static assets like images
  /utils                # Utility functions or helpers
  /services             # API requests and external services

Why Customize Folder Structure?

Organize by features: Group related files together for better maintainability.

Scalability: A well-organized structure makes it easier to scale the app as it grows.

Collaboration: When working in a team, a clear and consistent structure ensures smooth collaboration.
